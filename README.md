# Project 4: Stop and Wait Protocol
#### By Giorgi Alavidze, Liam Jeanette, and Evan Lang

In this project, we implemented a send and receive function for both users in a communication, which is then able to be used in order to call a stop and wait protocol for sending data over a series of messages. Our project was created using C++.
